      <h3 class="title">WANT TO SEE MORE SETS?</h3>
      I am aware of the demand for more sets! The most helpful thing to do is to
      gather and <a href="mailto:jwkeena@gmail.com">send me</a> the following
      three data points about the set you'd like added. First, find good photos
      of the front and back of all variations of the pack art. I've had good
      luck with front art at
      <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Base_Set_(TCG)#Gallery"
        >Bulbapedia</a
      >; back art tends to come from eBay listings. Second, watch enough YouTube
      pack openings to determine the exact rarity order (see
      <a href="#rules">Rules</a> below for examples). Third, find the chances of
      holos, secret rares, reverse holos, and any other quirk about the set. If
      I have all that information, it will be easy to add your set.
      <br />
      <br />
      I also

        >accept donations via PayPal on NeoCities</a
      >
      (look for the "Send a Tip" button). However, I won't add any that are
      currently
      <a href="https://www.ptcgoshop.com/card-packs">being monetized</a>
      by the Pokemon Trading Card Game Online. I'm strictly interested in
      historical preservation, and re-creating the experience of opening these
      packs.

      <h3 class="title">FOUND A BUG?</h3>

      <a href="mailto:jwkeena@gmail.com">Email me directly</a>
      and I'll add the issue to my backlog. Be sure to include which browser and
      platform you were using, as well as what you were doing when it happened.
      Bonus points if you include a screenshot.

      <h3 class="title">WANT TO REQUEST A NEW FEATURE?</h3>
      Many of the features on the simulator, especially in the original version,
      were user requests. Let me know what you'd like to see, and I'll see if I
      can add it.
      <br />
      <br />If you're submitting a new card distribution rule, check the list
      below to see what's already been implemented.

      Cards will appear in the following order by default:

        <li>Jungle: 7 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Expedition Base: 5 commons (holo pull replaces 5th common), 1 reverse

      These patterns have been extracted from numerous YouTube booster pack
      openings.

      <h3 class="title">DUPLICATES</h3>
      Duplicates have been prevented in the simulator, since they aren't meant
      to occur in physical packs. In the original 11 sets, it is possible to
      pull two of the same pokemon, but not with the identical art or card
      number. In expedition base set, it is possible to pull three of the same
      pokemon with the same art and card number, but of different rarity tiers:
      holographic, reverse holographic, and regular rare.
      <br />
      <br />
      There is, however, one exception of which I am aware. Duplicates are
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GpiwTuO-vw">frequent</a> and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc9A84i2FRw">idiosyncratic</a> in
      Legendary Collection packs. This has not been implemented in the simulator
      yet.

      You can't pull a Machamp from base set. But you already knew that.
