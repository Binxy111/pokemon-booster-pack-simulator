      <h3 class="title">WANT TO SEE MORE SETS?</h3>
      I am aware of the demand for more sets! The biggest encouragement for me
      to add more is for the site to reach a wider audience. I'd love to add
      more, the bigger the audience gets; so share the site with friends who
      would enjoy it. I also

        >accept donations via PayPal on NeoCities</a
      >
      (look for the "Send a Tip" button). If there are particular sets you want
      to see arrive first <a href="mailto:jwkeena@gmail.com">email me</a>.
      However, I won't add any that are currently
      <a href="https://www.ptcgoshop.com/card-packs">being monetized</a>
      by the Pokemon Trading Card Game Online. I'm strictly interested in
      historical preservation, and re-creating the experience of opening these
      packs.

      <a href="mailto:jwkeena@gmail.com">email me directly</a>
      and I'll address the issue as quickly as possible. Be sure to include

      <h3 class="title">WANT TO REQUEST A NEW FEATURE OR RULE?</h3>
      Many of the features on the simulator, especially in the original version,
      were user requests. Let me know what you'd like to see, and I'll see if I
      can add it.
      <br />
      <br />If you're submitting a new card distribution rule, check the list
      below to see what's already been implemented.

      openings.

      <h3 class="title">DUPLICATES</h3>
      Duplicates have been prevented in the simulator, since they aren't meant
      to occur in physical packs. In the original 11 sets, it is possible to
      pull two of the same pokemon, but not with the identical art or card
      number. In the expedition base set, it is possible to pull three of the
      same pokemon with the same art and card number, but of different rarity
      tiers: holographic, reverse holographic, and regular rare.
      <br />
      <br />

      <h3 class="title">MACHAMP</h3>
      You can't pull a Machamp from base set. But you already knew that.
