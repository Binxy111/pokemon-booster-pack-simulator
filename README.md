Made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this web application accurately captures the probability, rarity distribution, and experience of the first dozen+ sets.

# goals
The only way to open original packs of actual Pokemon cards is either to spend hundreds of dollars on eBay or to watch YouTubers enjoy the process for you. To recreate that experience virtually and for free, I used nested arrays of links to card images, random pack building customized for each set, and a duplicate-removing algorithm to accurately capture the probability, rarity distribution, and experience of opening the first dozen+ sets. My first major learning project, and now one of the most popular sites on Neocities. Mobile friendly.
