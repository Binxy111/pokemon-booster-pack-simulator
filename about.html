    <h3 class = "title">WANT TO SEE MORE SETS?</h3>
    I'd love to continue updating the site with more recent sets! Thanks kindly for your support :D
    <br>
    <br>
    To make the production of new sets and features sustainable,
    I'll add a new set for every $25 donated via <a href ="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=YKA72C3C3YJUU&currency_code=USD&source=url">Paypal</a>. 
    Each set can take a few hours to implement and test properly, 
    making my hourly rate quite low compared to the current national average (~$20) for web developers.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you don't request a specific set in your donation, 
    I'll add <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_expansions">
    the next least recent one</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    However, I won't add any that are currently <a href="https://www.ptcgoshop.com/card-packs">being monetized</a>
    by the Pokemon Trading Card Game Online. I'm strictly interested in historical preservation, and re-creating the 
    experience of opening these packs. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If you aren't in a position to donate, that's ok! Please continue to enjoy the site. The best thing
    you can do for its continued development is to share it with your friends and anyone who might enjoy it. Thanks again!

    <h3 class = "title">WANT TO REQUEST A NEW FEATURE OR RULE?</h3>
    Many of the features on the simulator, such as the same set button and the zoom ability, were user requests. 
    Let me know what you'd like to see, and I'll see if I can add it.
    <br>
    <br>If you're submitting a new card distribution rule, check the list below to see
    what's already been implemented. 
    Again, the best place to reach me currently is on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcg/comments/arrvm0/booster_pack_simulator_first_11_sets/">this subreddit</a>
    or <a href = "javascript:void();" onclick = "redirect()">by email</a>.

    <h3 class = "title">RARITY DISTRIBUTION</h3>
    Image key: &nbsp; <img class = "rarity_about" src = "rarity_rare.png"> = rare &nbsp;
    <img class = "rarity_about" src = "rarity_uncommon.png"> = uncommon &nbsp;
    <img class = "rarity_about" src = "rarity_common.png"> = common &nbsp;

    <img class = "rarity_about" src = "unown_question_mark.gif"> = random
    <br>
    <br>
    When shuffle is turned off, cards will always appear in the following order:
    <ol> 
        <li>Base: 7 commons (2 of which are energy), 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>
        <li>Jungle: 7 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>
        <li>Fossil: 7 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>
        <li>Base 2: 3 uncommons, 5 commons, 1 rare, 2 energy</li>
        <li>Team Rocket: 7 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>
        <li>Gym Heroes: 6 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons, 1 energy</li>
        <li>Gym Challenge: 6 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons, 1 energy</li>
        <li>Neo Genesis: 1 energy, 1 rare, 3 uncommons, 6 commons</li>
        <li>Neo Discovery: 3 uncommon, 1 rare, 7 commons</li>
        <li>Neo Revelation: 7 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>
        <li>Neo Destiny: 7 commons, 1 rare, 3 uncommons</li>
    </ol>
    These patterns have been extracted from numerous YouTube booster pack openings.

    <h3 class = "title">DUPLICATES</h3>
    Duplicates have been prevented in the simulator, since they aren't meant to occur in the physical game.
    It is possible to pull two of the same pokemon, but not with the identical art or card number.
